     * A Map is a collection consisting of keys and values.
     * It's called a map because unique keys are mapped to other values.
     * A key and its accompanying value are often called a key-value pair.
     * A map's keys are unique. A map's values, however, are not.
     * Two different keys could map to the same value. For example, "Mercury" has 0 moons, and "Venus" has 0 moons.
     *
     * Accessing a value from a map by its key is generally faster than searching through a large list, such as with indexOf().
     *
     * Maps can be declared using the mapOf() or mutableMapOf() function.
     * Maps require two generic types separated by a commaâ€”one for the keys and another for the values.
